# html-but-js

## Introduction
html_but_js v1.0.0 is an alternative method for Web Developers to create Websites, by using JS Code only. The core concept behind html_but_js is to minimize the manual creation of html tags and at the same time minimize the amount of errors which may not be visible in production.

The other benefit of html_but_js (if used correctly, I still haven't figured it all out) is minimizing the amount of code necessary for a website. In the long-term html_but_js will successfully help apply the necessary changes with minimum effort.
